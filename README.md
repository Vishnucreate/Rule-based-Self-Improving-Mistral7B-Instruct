# Rule-based-Self-Improving-Mistral7B-Instruct
Using Rule based scenario the contents are iteratively improved

# 🧠 Self-Critique “Looping Blog Writer” (Mistral-7B)

## 📘 Overview  
This notebook demonstrates an **autonomous, rule-based content generator** powered by the free, open-source **Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2** model.  
It writes blog posts, evaluates its own output against quality rules, and iteratively rewrites until every check passes — a self-improving content-creation loop.  

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives  
1. **Automate Content Production:**  
   Replace manual blog drafting with an AI agent that can plan, write, and refine posts to consistent standards.  
2. **Ensure Brand Consistency and Readability:**  
   Built-in evaluation rules guarantee minimum length, engaging introductions, clear structure, and professional tone.  
3. **Reduce Editing Costs:**  
   The self-critique loop minimizes human post-editing, producing publish-ready text in fewer iterations.  
4. **Scalable AI Copywriting:**  
   Allows teams to generate dozens of well-structured, SEO-friendly posts per day without API fees.  
5. **Demonstrate Agentic Feedback Loops:**  
   Serves as a template for any system where the model generates → evaluates → rewrites autonomously.

## ⚙️ How It Works  
| Step | Component | Purpose |
|------|------------|----------|
| 1️⃣ | **Model Loading** | Loads `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2` locally in Colab — no keys required. |
| 2️⃣ | **Synthetic Instruction Prompt** | Defines writing guidelines (tone, markdown headers, examples, CTA). |
| 3️⃣ | **Evaluation Functions** | Rule-based checks: word count, engaging hook, section headers, summary/CTA. |
| 4️⃣ | **Generation Function** | Uses Mistral-7B to write or rewrite a blog draft. |
| 5️⃣ | **Loop Controller** | Runs generation → evaluation → rewrite until all checks succeed or limit reached. |

## 🧩 Key Code Blocks
```python
# Load model
from transformers import pipeline
generator = pipeline("text-generation",
    model="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2",
    device_map="auto", torch_dtype="auto")

# Evaluation + generation loop
topic = "How AI is Revolutionizing Personal Productivity"
final_blog = loop_until_good(topic)
print(final_blog)
💡 Achievements
Autonomous self-improvement: model learns from its own failures within a single session.

Quality-assured text generation: enforces measurable standards (≥500 words, ≥3 sections, engaging hook).

Cost-efficient pipeline: runs entirely on free/open Hugging Face models — no API or paid tokens.

Reusable agentic pattern: same loop can govern product descriptions, reports, or marketing copy.

📊 Business Impact
Metric	Before	After
Drafting time per blog	~2 hours	3–5 minutes
Human editing required	High	Minimal
Consistency of tone	Variable	Standardized
Cost per post	~$20–30	~$0 (Colab compute only)

🏁 Outcome
This project demonstrates a self-evaluating generative AI workflow: a model that not only writes but judges and improves its own work.
It provides a practical foundation for enterprise AI writing assistants, marketing automation, and educational content generation — scalable, controllable, and 100 % open source.
